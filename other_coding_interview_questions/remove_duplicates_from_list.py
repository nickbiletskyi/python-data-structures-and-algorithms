List: Remove Duplicates ( ** Interview Question)
Given a sorted list of integers, rearrange the list in-place such that all unique elements appear at the beginning of the list.

Your function should return the new length of the list containing only unique elements. Note that you should not create a new list or use any additional data structures to solve this problem. The original list should be modified in-place.
Constraints:
The input list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The input list may contain duplicates.
The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
The function should have a space complexity of O(1), i.e., it should not use any additional data structures or create new lists (this also means you cannot use a set like we did earlier in the course).

Example:

Input: nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] Function call: new_length = remove_duplicates(nums) Output: new_length = 5 Modified list: nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] (first 5 elements are unique)

Explanation: The function modifies the original list nums in-place, moving unique elements to the beginning of the list, followed by duplicate elements. The new length returned by the function is 5, indicating that there are 5 unique elements in the list. The first 5 elements of the modified list nums are the unique elements [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

This code:
nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
new_length = remove_duplicates(nums)
print("New length:", new_length)
print("Unique values in list:", nums[:new_length])

Should Output:

New length: 5
Unique values in list: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
